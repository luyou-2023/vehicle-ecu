# vehicle-ecu

.ino file is an Arduino sketch. Currently using an Uno though I may upgrade to get more digital I/O pins.

.py file is written for python 3.6

This is no where near the finished project. There is a base framework for Arduino <-> PC communication. Only the data for fuel injector times are being sent and displayed. TKinter is the GUI framework.
